          <em>4th Year Computer Science Student at

        <p>
          I am currently a QA Automation Test Intern with Revenue Solutions Inc., and I am proficient in the Java programming language.
          I also have some interest in data analysis and I have course experience with R as well. I would like to continue to grow my
          skills and am currently taking a full stack web development course in order to familiarize myself with developing web applications.
          When I'm not working or in school, I enjoy watching <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/">anime</a> and reading what catches my interest for the day - top news headlines,
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit forums</a>, tech articles, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/">fanfiction</a>, anything really. I also enjoy trying new foods and working out so that I can continue to
          eat new foods in peace. In the future, I hope to grow my knowledge and achieve financial freedom and work doing something I enjoy
          without having to worry about if it pays the bills or not.
